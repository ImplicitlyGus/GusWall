# MultiResetWall

A wall-style multi-instance macro for Minecraft RSG resetting

## Instructions

A similar setup to [my normal multi-instance macro](https://gist.github.com/Specnr/c851a92a258dd1fdbe3eee588f3f14d8), but with a few more steps.

To start, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Specnr/MultiResetWall/releases/latest), and extract the zip into a folder. Dont move the files out of the folder,
if you need to, you can make a shortcut for TheWall.ahk and move that outside.

Update the configurable variables in the macro to match your setup. :)

Additionally, you need to make a new OBS scene with all your instances visible, and make an OBS hotkey to be F12 to switch to that scene.

## Usage

To use the macro, run TheWall.ahk and wait for it to say ready. Start up OBS, then start up a [Fullscreen projector](https://youtu.be/9YqZ6Ogv3rk).
To reset an instance, you can either press the instance number (1-9) or you can hover over the instance on the projector and press "E".
To play an instance, you can either hold shift and press the instance number (1-9) or you can hover over the instance on the projector and press "R".
