# MultiResetWall

A wall-style multi-instance macro for Minecraft RSG resetting

## Instructions

A similar setup to [my normal multi-instance macro](https://gist.github.com/Specnr/c851a92a258dd1fdbe3eee588f3f14d8), but with a few more steps.

To start, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Specnr/MultiResetWall/releases/latest), and extract the zip into a folder. Dont move the files out of the folder,
if you need to, you can make a shortcut for TheWall.ahk and move that outside.

Additionally, you need to make a new OBS scene with all your instances visible, and make an OBS hotkey to be F12 to switch to that scene.

## Usage

To use the macro, run TheWall.ahk and wait for it to say ready. It should bring up a GUI with a bunch of numbers. Press on a number while having the controller active
to reset that instance, or you can press the number itself (1-9) at the top of your keyboard to do the same. To play an instance hold shift and press that instance's button/number.
If you want to manually switch back to the wall scene, press the back button.

Note: Setting titles isnt needed here, it will automatically do so on boot
