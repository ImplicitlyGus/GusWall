# MultiResetWall

A wall-style multi-instance macro for Minecraft RSG resetting

## Instructions

Watch the [NEW Multi Instance & Wall Setup Video](https://youtu.be/0xAHMW93MQw)

## Usage

To use the macro, run TheWall.ahk and wait for it to say ready. Start up OBS, then start up a [Fullscreen projector](https://youtu.be/9YqZ6Ogv3rk).

On the Fullscreen projector, you have a few hotkeys: 
- (1-9): Will reset the instance with the corresponding number
- Shift + (1-9): Will play the instance with the corresponding number
- E: Will reset the instance which your mouse is hovering over
- R: Will play the instance which your mouse is hovering over
- F: Will play the instance which your mouse is hovering over, and reset all of the other ones
- T: Will reset all instances
- Shift + L Mouse button: Lock instance so other "blanket reset" functions skip over it

No longer moves worlds, it slows down the macro a lot, use [this world moving macro](https://gist.github.com/Specnr/f7a5450d932a1277fdcd6c141ad7bf6a).
